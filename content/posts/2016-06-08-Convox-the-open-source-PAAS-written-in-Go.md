## Wednesday 9th June 2016 - Convox, the open source PAAS written in Go

On the day if you need any help with the meetup call Will on 07939 547 962.

### The session

From the speaker:

> My name is Luke Roberts and I recently started working for [Convox](https://convox.com/) which is an open source, private PAAS written predominantly in Go. Years of experience coupled with the testing of a large open source community and access to a huge library of pre built images makes using Convox a robust and reliable yet developer friendly experience. I will discuss how it works, what it’s like developing in the open, how you can get involved and be doing a short demo.
>
> I also invite you to bring a long any dockerized projects and I would be happy to help you test it out for yourself (potentially in the pub)!

### About the Speaker

> Luke Roberts is a programmer working for [Convox](https://convox.com/) who has been active in the Go community for a number of years.
