<h3 id="how-go-got-us-over-the-humps---here-are-the-whats-and-hows">1. How Go got us over the humps - here are the “Whats” and “Hows”</h3>

<p>An in depth, technical presentation on where go has recently been a “deadline saver” for bet365 across 5 major projects. This presentation could almost be described as “a parallel life to Erlang”. Here, Andy will detail using several examples where Golang has repeatedly offered us something that simply was not possible in the space that we had available, to solve a particular problem.</p>

<p>James will start with an overview of the bet365 Forensic Monitoring systems, and the challenges they face. The presentation will focus on how using Go has given  us easy access to powerful concurrency features, allowing thousands of requests to be processed per second, extremely efficiently. A review of some specific solutions to these challenges including some sample code and worked examples will be included.</p>
